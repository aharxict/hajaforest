						We’re working hard for our product to be delivered as soon as possible, at the lowest rates. That’s why we use Canada Post. Once the order is in and shipped, you will receive a tracking number so you can track your parcel along the way. <br> <br>

						For all orders placed on flambette.com, we offer a fixed shipping rate of $12. For orders over $59 (before taxes), we offer free shipping everywhere in Canada and United States. <br> <br>

						We ship our orders within 4 to 6 working days. However, if a product was in production and a delay was needed, you would be notified by email. We currently ship to Canada and to the United States. Sign up for our newsletter to be notified about any changes.

						We accept returns up to 30 days following the date of delivery. The item must be returned at your expense, unused and in the same condition as it was when received. The refund will be issued once we receive the item. However, shipping fees will not be refunded.
