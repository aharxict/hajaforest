			<h5><strong>Transfer of personal data to third parties and/or other countries</strong></h5>

			<p>As a general principle, we process personal data in order to facilitate or improve the Bang & Olufsen Group’s offerings and services to you. We do purchase supplementary data from public sources to complement our data bases. <br> 
			We do not process personal data on behalf of third parties, nor do we sell personal data to, or share personal data with, third parties for their own, independent use, except if you allow us to do so. <br>
			We do share personal data with third party vendors when it is necessary to provide services that we don’t perform ourselves, e.g. shipping of Naja Forest products, mailing of Naja Forest Newsletters, etc. <br>
			We also use third party data hosting companies to store personal data collected by us in their servers, and to do data validation checks for us. <br> <br>

			All data transfers to third party vendors or partners, including those listed as examples above will be subject to a written contract between us and the third party vendor or partner in question, and the vendor or partner will not have any authority to use such personal data for any purpose other than as instructed by us. <br>
			When relevant, personal information may be shared among the business units and entities inside the Naja Forest Group. [insert link to Naja Forest web page where the list of entities appear]. <br>
			We will disclose personal data when legally obligated to do so under subpoena or court order, or for law enforcement purposes.</p>
